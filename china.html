            The early Chinese people were isolated from other civilizations by
            their land's location and geography. China has the Himalayan
            Mountains in the south, great deserts in the north, and the Pacific
            Ocean to the east. Like other ancient civilizations, ancient China
            began with farming settlements in river valleys. Civilizations began
            to grow near China's two main rivers, the Yellow River and the
            Yangtze River, around 4000 BC.

          <p class="section-content">
            During this time, what we now call China developed from a collection
            of isolated cultural communities to a set of organized states which
            eventually coalesced around the idea of a single unified state, and
            then expanded to include contact with other civilizations.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            The first step was the development of agriculture. This resulted in
            settled life which produced surplus or stored goods. As more and
            more cultures came into close contact, the need for defense arose,
            and communities were walled in for protection. Societies became
            stratified around rulers and subjects, with allegiances and
            authority based on clan lines. Organized warfare on a massive scale
            began. In its rise to civilization, China developed a system of
            writing, various beliefs about heaven and the cosmos, as well as
            technological breakthroughs that allowed for political control and
            economic expansion.
          </p>

          <p class="section-content">
            The rise of civilization in China meant a gradual process of
            organizing disparate groups around a set of common beliefs, first by
            force, and then by articulating what it meant to be Chinese. This
            self-consciousness of ‘Chinese-ness’ first occurred during the
            Eastern Zhou dynasty (770‒221 BCE) when a ‘hundred schools’ of
            philosophy debated everything from the nature of man to notions of
            proper conduct and the ideal ruler. This period was so influential
            that later dynasties would refer back to it as a measure of their
            own worth.

            The Neolithic period, or New Stone Age, is usually broken down into
            regional areas, such as North-eastern China, North-Central, Eastern,
            South-eastern and South-central China. Furthermore, each area can be
            broken down into earlier and later Neolithic cultures.

          <p class="section-content">
            The Erlitou period, named after the excavated site of an ancient
            capital, continues to be a source of debate. Some historians believe
            it to be the site of the ancient Xia dynasty. Others consider it to
            be the early stages of the Shang dynasty. Dates for the Erlitou,
            Erligang and Anyang phases of ancient China are also subject to
            debate. The period of time from the Xia through the Zhou is often
            referred to as the Bronze Age in China.
          </p>
          <p class="section-content">
            Western and Eastern signify a change in the capital of that dynasty
            from west to east, for example from ancient Chang’an (Xi’an) to
            Luoyang. The Eastern Zhou is divided up into several periods. During
            theWarring States, for example, power shifts to several competing
            states. Zhou continues to rule as a puppet state while others jostle
            for power. The Qin eventually suceed in defeating all other states,
            uniting China for the first time. Imperial China begins at this
            point.
